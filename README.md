# Real-time-face-detection
The key objective of this research is to develop a real-time system for face detection and emotion prediction using advanced computer vision and deep learning techniques. Specifically, the system aims to:
1. Detects faces in real-time using the YOLOv5 algorithm.
2. Recognize and predict eight core emotions (happy, sad, angry, fear, disgust, surprise, confused, and neutral) using Facial Expression Recognition (FER).
3. Process live video feeds under diverse conditions, such as uneven lighting and varied backgrounds, using OpenCV.
4. Create a robust system that can be applied in real-world scenarios, particularly for individuals with disabilities, children with autism, and bedridden patients.
The ultimate goal is to enhance human-computer interaction and provide valuable applications in fields such as healthcare, education, and assistive technologies by enabling more natural and emotionally aware communication between humans and machines.
